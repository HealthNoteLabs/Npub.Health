# Npub.Health Dashboard Implementation Plan

## 1. Dashboard Architecture

- Create a modular dashboard layout with drag-and-drop customizable widgets
- Implement a responsive grid system that works on both desktop and mobile
- Design a central state management system for health metrics data
- Build a caching layer for efficient data retrieval and offline functionality

## 2. Core Components

### Data Repository Layer
- Build relay connection service to fetch NIP-101h health metrics
- Implement Blossom integration for private data storage/retrieval
- Create data normalization utilities for metric and imperial unit conversion
- Develop deduplication algorithms for metrics from multiple sources

### Dashboard Components
- Design metric cards that display current health values with change indicators
- Create trend visualization charts with configurable time ranges
- Implement correlation view to compare different health metrics
- Build workout history timeline with filtering options

### Data Management UI
- Create import/export controls for moving data between storage options
- Build privacy management dashboard showing data storage locations
- Implement storage location selector for each metric type

## 3. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Dashboard Framework
- Set up responsive grid layout system
- Create widget container components
- Implement dashboard customization controls
- Build state management for dashboard configuration

### Phase 2: Data Services
- Implement relay connection service 
- Create Blossom integration service
- Build data normalization and deduplication logic
- Develop caching system for offline functionality

### Phase 3: Visualization Components
- Create metric cards for current values
- Implement interactive charts for trends
- Build correlation visualization component
- Create workout history display

### Phase 4: Data Management Features
- Implement import/export controls
- Build privacy management interface
- Create storage location settings
- Add NIP-44 encryption options for sensitive data

## 4. Technical Considerations

- Use React for component-based UI architecture
- Implement custom hooks for data fetching and state management
- Use a charting library like D3.js or Chart.js for visualizations
- Implement service workers for offline functionality
- Create a responsive design system using TailwindCSS or similar
- Consider WebSockets for real-time data updates from relays

## 5. User Experience Enhancements

- Implement skeleton loaders during data fetching
- Add tooltips explaining privacy implications of storage choices
- Create visual indicators for data freshness and source
- Implement interactive tutorials for first-time users
- Design consistent visual language for health metrics
